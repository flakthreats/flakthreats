[translate:# GitBirb BNB (GBB)

GitBirb BNB is an experimental BEP‑20 token on BNB Smart Chain, created as a learning project with open-source code and a transparent launch process via GitHub and no‑code/low‑code tools.

## Key facts
- Standard: BEP‑20 (ERC‑20 compatible).
- Network: BNB Smart Chain (BSC).
- Ticker: GBB.
- Goal: demonstrate the full lifecycle — from idea and repository to deploy and initial liquidity listing.

## Token creation options

### Option A: Four.meme (no‑code)
Four.meme is a decentralized launchpad on BNB Chain with a minimal deploy cost (~0.005 BNB), a preset supply of 1,000,000,000, and auto‑listing of liquidity after the bonding curve is completed.
1. Open four.meme and click Create Token.
2. Fill in name, ticker, description, upload a logo, and optionally set a start time and buy limits.
3. Confirm deployment with a wallet (Binance Web3 Wallet/MetaMask/Trust/TokenPocket).
4. After the bonding curve reaches 100%, the platform automatically seeds liquidity on PancakeSwap.

### Option B: Smart contract via Remix
If custom code is needed, use BEP‑20 templates and deploy via Remix.
1. Open Remix IDE and add a BEP‑20 contract (see template repositories).
2. Compile with the contract’s Solidity version.
3. Connect a wallet (MetaMask) to BSC, choose Injected Provider — MetaMask, and deploy.
4. Verify the contract on BscScan and publish the ABI.

- BEP‑20 templates on GitHub for a quick start (Solidity).
- Simple example contract and step‑by‑step deploy via Remix/MetaMask.

## Fees and costs
- Four.meme deploy is around 0.005 BNB (effectively network gas).
- Gas for deploy/calls in Remix depends on BSC network load.
